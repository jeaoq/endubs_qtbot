# @wttm_qtbot

[@wttm_qtbot](https://twitter.com/wttm_qtbot) is a Twitter bot that publishes (translated) quotes pertaining to Tomoya Mashiro and Wataru Hibiki's relationship ~~in hopes of making others consider the pair~~. More quotes will be added over time.

This README is also in the works.

## Features

When a user replies to a tweet asking for a quote's source, the bot will reply with the character who said the quote, who it's spoken to, the chapter it's from, and the writer of that story. It will respond this to tweets containing "source", "story", "who", *or* "said".

Planned Features
- Random quote when @'ed "random"
- Random quotes based on who said it (Tomoya or Wataru)
- In-game screenshots if @'ed "image"

## Attribution

This bot is basically a fork of [QuoteableSatoshi](https://github.com/dergigi/QuotableSatoshi). Translations are mainly from the [Ensemble Stars Wiki](https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/), with some lines edited to be grammatically correct or sound better out of context. Some lines are translated by myself.
