[@wttm_qtbot](https://twitter.com/wttm_qtbot) is a Twitter bot that publishes (translated) quotes pertaining to Tomoya Mashiro and Wataru Hibiki's relationship.

This bot is still under construction. More quotes will be added over time.

For more information, visit the bot's [README](https://github.com/watatomo/wttm_qtbot/blob/master/README.md). A proper documentation is in the works.

# Features

Tweets every hour, but can be changed. Planning to switch over to one tweet every 30 minutes when there are enough quotes added.

Reply to a quote tweet with "source" or "story", and the bot will answer back with the speaker, recipient, chapter, and writer of that story.

## To-do

- Random quote when mentioned "random"
- Random quotes based on who said it (Tomoya or Wataru)
  - If mentioned "Tomoya quote", reply with a quote from Tomoya
- Reply with in-game screenshots if mentioned "image"
  - Get those screenshots
- Documentation page
- Make the bot actually work
